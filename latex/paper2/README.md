# Paper 2

Steps:
1) Find people how have worked on similar problems (or sub-problems) that
are related to mine and see how they went about to solve it. To make sure
I am not forgetting.  
2) If no one has done it, then propose a solution and people will come
to propose different approaches that are going to be fasters.
